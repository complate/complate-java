## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-07

This release contains a new renderer that uses the Graal JavaScript engine.

### üì£ Notes
- Although we recommend using the new `GraalComplateRenderer` if you plan on
  using the `NashornComplateRenderer` you should add an exclusion to
  `org.graalvm.js:js`.
- `NashornComplateRenderer` is deprecated and will be removed in the near
  future. Please migrate to the new `GraalComplateRenderer` ([592d7e3](https://github.com/complate/complate-java/commit/592d7e342dc9e5b4a85e61c2604675ddd40f2e93)).
- `GraalComplateRenderer` is not a drop-in replacement for `NashornComplateRenderer` -
  see the
  [FAQ](./FAQ.md#can-i-replace-nashorncomplaterenderer-with-graalcomplaterenderer).

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New Features
- New `GraalComplateRenderer` ([3d7ea5d](https://github.com/complate/complate-java/commit/3d7ea5d737e93ebaf8d877161e78ec8c66680c4b)).

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-06

This release contains of the initial code extraction from
[complate-spring-mvc](https://github.com/complate/complate-spring-mvc).

It contains a few breaking changes that you will need to change when upgrading:

1. The parameter order of the JavaScript render method changed to
   `stream, view, params`.
2. The `ViewResolver` changed from `com.github.complate.ComplateViewResolver` to
   `org.complate.spring.mvc.ComplateViewResolver`.
3. The `com.github.complate.ScriptingEngine` changed to
   `org.complate.core.ComplateRenderer`.
4. The `com.github.complate.NashornScriptingBridge` changed to
   `org.complate.nashorn.NashornComplateRenderer`.

If you rely on the previous behaviour that your JavaScript file is read on every
request you further need to wrap `org.complate.nashorn.NashornComplateRenderer`
within a `org.complate.core.renderer.ComplateReEvaluatingRenderer`. This may be
slower than before (because the `ScriptingEngine` is then recreated on every
request) but for production usage without wrapping the performance should be
increased.

### üì£ Notes
- Multiple breaking changes as described above.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New Features
- JavaScript file can be read only once which enhances performance.

### üî® Dependency Upgrades
- Upgrade to Servlet 4.0.1
