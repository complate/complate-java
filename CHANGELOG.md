## [Unreleased]


## [1.0.0] - 2023-02-15

This release upgrades Servlet API to version 6. Because this version includes
the namespace change to jakarta and requires a JDK baseline of JDK 11 you may
need to update other libraries, too.

### üì£ Notes
- Because of Servlet API upgrade the JDK baseline is now JDK 11
- Because of the Servlet API namespace change to jakarta you may need to
  update/change some of your dependencies when updating complate-java.

### üî® Dependency Upgrades
- Upgrade Servlet API to jakarta namespace and update to version 6

## [0.3.0] - 2022-09-23

This release updates Nashorn to the open source
[`org.openjdk.nashorn`](https://github.com/szegedi/nashorn) branch and splits
the project into three separate modules:

- `complate-core` contains the API relevant classes and interfaces and some
  utilities.
- `complate-graal` contains the GraalVM based implementation.
- `complate-nashorn` contains the Nashorn based implementation.

If you update from a previous release note that you need to change your
dependency to one of the modules that contain your desired implementation!

### üì£ Notes
- `NashornComplateRenderer` has been updated to use the open source
  [`org.openjdk.nashorn`](https://github.com/szegedi/nashorn) branch of Nashorn
  since Nashorn has been removed from newer JDK versions
- The project is split into three modules `complate-core`, `complate-nashorn`,
  and `complate-graal`.

### üî® Dependency Upgrades
- Upgrade to Graal 22.2.0

## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-07

This release contains a new renderer that uses the Graal JavaScript engine.

### üì£ Notes
- Although we recommend using the new `GraalComplateRenderer` if you plan on
  using the `NashornComplateRenderer` you should add an exclusion to
  `org.graalvm.js:js`.
- `NashornComplateRenderer` is deprecated and will be removed in the near
  future. Please migrate to the new `GraalComplateRenderer` ([592d7e3](https://github.com/complate/complate-java/commit/592d7e342dc9e5b4a85e61c2604675ddd40f2e93)).
- `GraalComplateRenderer` is not a drop-in replacement for `NashornComplateRenderer` -
  see the
  [FAQ](./FAQ.md#can-i-replace-nashorncomplaterenderer-with-graalcomplaterenderer).

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New Features
- New `GraalComplateRenderer` ([3d7ea5d](https://github.com/complate/complate-java/commit/3d7ea5d737e93ebaf8d877161e78ec8c66680c4b)).

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-06

This release contains of the initial code extraction from
[complate-spring-mvc](https://github.com/complate/complate-spring-mvc).

It contains a few breaking changes that you will need to change when upgrading:

1. The parameter order of the JavaScript render method changed to
   `stream, view, params`.
2. The `ViewResolver` changed from `com.github.complate.ComplateViewResolver` to
   `org.complate.spring.mvc.ComplateViewResolver`.
3. The `com.github.complate.ScriptingEngine` changed to
   `org.complate.core.ComplateRenderer`.
4. The `com.github.complate.NashornScriptingBridge` changed to
   `org.complate.nashorn.NashornComplateRenderer`.

If you rely on the previous behaviour that your JavaScript file is read on every
request you further need to wrap `org.complate.nashorn.NashornComplateRenderer`
within a `org.complate.core.renderer.ComplateReEvaluatingRenderer`. This may be
slower than before (because the `ScriptingEngine` is then recreated on every
request) but for production usage without wrapping the performance should be
increased.

### üì£ Notes
- Multiple breaking changes as described above.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New Features
- JavaScript file can be read only once which enhances performance.

### üî® Dependency Upgrades
- Upgrade to Servlet 4.0.1
